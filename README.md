## InfluxDB

# Metallb

# Secrets
Secrets are a good way to safely store passwords and other sensible data with kubernetes.    
They are accessible in container by a volume.    
Our secrets are stored in ./configs    
- mariadb-secret
- phpmyadmin-secret

## Scripts

- secret_encrypt.sh: Script thats contain all passwords and print their Base64-encrypt version.
- container-build: Script thats create images from a path to dockerfile.     
- setupdebug: recreate and deploy a service pass in param. (wp, maria, php, nginx).
- configMetalLB: Extention of setup.sh, allow to safely apply a new metallb configmap.

## Usefull commands:
- get container logs   
    `kubectl logs  >pod<   > logs`

- get into a container    
    `kubectl exec -ti >pod< sh`

- delete/create metallb config
    `kubectl delete configmap -n metallb-system config`
    `kubectl create -f srcs/metallb/configmap.yaml`
